    <strong>trustrelay.com</strong> connects people and jobs through a network of trust.<br/>
    This service is pretty generic. Jobs can be anything from babysitting to management positions.
  </p>
  <h3>Why should I join?</h3>
    <p>
       The following assumption drives the network: <br/>
       - your standing with your current employer benefits if you provide good candidates for job oppertunities at your current workplace<br/>
       - your standing with people you are connected to benefits if you relay them interesting job oppertunities<br/>
       - your standing with people that relay you job oppertunities benefits if you relay them on to good candidates<br/>
       - employers prefer candidates related by trust to their current workforce
    </p>
    <h3>How do I join ?</h3>
     <p>Get invited by someone already in the network or sign up to start your own network</p>
